# Welcome! 👋

## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I graduated from De La Salle University - Manila (DLSU), Philippines, with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, majoring in Computer Systems Engineering.

🙇 I have a keen interest in **machine learning and computer vision**.

🎷 Outside of my academic and tech pursuits, I enjoy playing the saxophone and listening to jazz music. I also love cooking, exercising, and playing video games! Currently, I'm learning Japanese in my free time.

✈️ Japan holds a special place in my heart! I want to experience the country’s unique and diverse culture, especially in smaller, lesser-known regions.

**I am currently a Master's student at Osaka University's Graduate School of Information Science and Technology.**
