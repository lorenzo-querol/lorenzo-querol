# Welcome! 👋

I want to make this an archive of all the projects I've done so far (Currently uploading them!)

## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I'm Lorenzo Querol, a fourth year senior undergraduate student at De La Salle University - Manila (DLSU), Philippines. I am currently taking up my Bachelors's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Computer Systems Engineering.

🙇 I enjoy learning about Artificial Intelligence such as **deep learning and machine learning applications in Computer Vision**. I continuously read research articles to further improve my knowledge in these domains, and keep myself updated with current trends. I also like to embed this knowledge into **web and mobile development** so others can have access to these services.

🎷 Outside of the academic and tech bubble, I like to play my saxophone and listen to jazz music. I also love to cook, work out, and play games! I am currently learning Japanese during my free time since I want to study there in the future.

✈️ I love to travel, specifically to Japan 🗾! I always want to experience the unique and diverse culture that the country has to offer, like eating local delicacies or traveling to the smaller, less known regions.

## 🏆 Achievements

📰 I've participated in two research papers that were part of the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) Annual Conference in 2022. If you're interested, please take your time to read them!
