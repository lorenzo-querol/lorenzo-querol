#### Welcome! 

I'm Lorenzo Querol, a 4th year senior undergraduate student at De La Salle University - Manila (DLSU). I am currently taking up Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with specialization in Computer Systems Engineering.

My research interests are Deep Learning and Machine Learning applications in Computer Vision (CV), and continuously reading research articles to further improve my knowledge in these domains, and keep myself updated with current trends. I also like to connect AI applications and embed them into my knowledge of web and mobile development so that others can contribute or use these services for their needs.

I have participated in 2 research papers. If you are interested, please do take your time to read them.

- [Automated Cocoa Pod Borer Detection using an Edge Computing-based Deep Learning Algorithm](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362080849_Automated_Cocoa_Pod_Borer_Detection_using_an_Edge_Computing-based_Deep_Learning_Algorithm)

- [Applying Generative Adversarial Networks for Sticky Paper Trap Image Generation and Object Detector Performance Enhancement](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362080593_Applying_Generative_Adversarial_Networks_for_Sticky_Paper_Trap_Image_Generation_and_Object_Detector_Performance_Enhancement)
