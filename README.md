# Welcome! 👋

I want to make this an archive of all the projects I've done so far (Currently uploading them).

## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I'm a graduate of De La Salle University - Manila (DLSU), Philippines with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, majoring in Computer Systems Engineering.

🙇 I'm interested in **machine learning, particularly in computer vision**. I'd like to create personal projects that allow others to learn more about this field in an intuitive manner.

🎷 Outside of the academic and tech bubble, I like to play my saxophone and listen to jazz music. I also love to cook, work out, and play games! I am currently learning Japanese during my free time since I want to study there in the future.

✈️ I love Japan! I always yearn to experience the unique and diverse culture that the country has to offer, like eating local delicacies or traveling to the smaller, lesser-known regions. 

**Currently, I'm applying as a graduate student at Osaka University's Graduate School of Information Science and Technology**
